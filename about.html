      The alluring scent of biriyani attracts foodies from every corner to the
      bustling lanes of Barrackpore. Since the late 1980s, biryani lovers have
      flocked to this establishment, a tradition that traces back to the teenage
      years of brothers Sanjib Saha and Rajib Saha.

    <p class="text-blk subHeading">
      In 1961, my father migrated from Bihar to Kolkata, where we established
      our first eatery near Barrackpore railway station. Initially offering only
      a daily meal, our eatery remained nameless for several years. Nearly 15
      years later, I assumed responsibility for the eatery, expanding its menu
      to include a variety of dishes. Over time, my wife, Sandhya Saha, joined
      me in managing the eatery, earning us the endearing title of "Dada Boudi"
      (meaning brother and sister-in-law in Bengali). Consequently, our eatery
      became affectionately known as "Dada Boudi." Our sons, Sanjib Saha and
      Rajib Saha, served as helping hands to us since childhood. Years later,
      they unveiled this tantalizing dish in our family's humble 200-square-foot
      eatery. The beginning was back-breaking, but our patience and hard work
      have led to fame and success in the upcoming years.
